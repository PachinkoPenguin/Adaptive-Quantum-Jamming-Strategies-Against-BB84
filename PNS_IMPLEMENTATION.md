# Photon Number Splitting (PNS) Attack Implementation

## Overview

The **Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attack** is the most dangerous known attack on practical BB84 quantum key distribution systems. It exploits a fundamental limitation: real QKD systems use weak coherent pulses (WCP) instead of true single photons, making them vulnerable to undetectable eavesdropping.

**Key Insight:** PNS attack introduces **ZERO QBER** - completely undetectable!

---

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Problem with Weak Coherent Pulses

Practical BB84 systems use weak coherent laser pulses, not true single photons:

```
|α⟩ = e^(-μ/2) Σ (α^n / √n!) |n⟩
```

The photon number distribution follows **Poisson statistics**:

```
P(n photons) = μⁿ e^(-μ) / n!
```

Where μ is the mean photon number (typically 0.1-0.5).

### Multi-Photon Vulnerability

The probability of a multi-photon pulse (n ≥ 2):

```
P(n≥2) = 1 - P(n=0) - P(n=1) = 1 - (1 + μ)e^(-μ)
```

**Example values:**
- μ = 0.1: P(n≥2) = 0.47% (secure but vulnerable)
- μ = 0.2: P(n≥2) = 1.75%
- μ = 0.5: P(n≥2) = 9.02% (highly vulnerable)

### The Attack Mechanism

1. **Non-destructive monitoring**: Eve splits off extra photons from multi-photon pulses
2. **Store and wait**: Eve stores the stolen photons without measuring
3. **Basis reconciliation**: Alice and Bob publicly announce their bases
4. **Perfect measurement**: Eve measures stored photons in the correct basis

**Result**: Eve gains 1 full bit for each multi-photon pulse with **ZERO disturbance**!

## Implementation

### PhotonNumberSplittingAttack Class

```python
from src.main.bb84_main import PhotonNumberSplittingAttack

strategy = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack(
    backend,
    mean_photon_number=0.1  # Typical μ value
)
```

### Key Methods

#### 1. Probability Calculations

```python
# Multi-photon probability
prob = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack.probability_multi_photon(mu=0.1)
# Returns: 0.0047 (0.47%)

# Expected information gain
info = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack.expected_information_gain(mu=0.1)
# Returns: 0.0047 bits/pulse

# Optimal μ for distance
optimal_mu = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack.optimal_mu_for_distance(loss_db=10.0)
# Returns: 0.1 (for 10 dB loss)
```

#### 2. Attack Execution

```python
# Always monitor (non-destructive)
should_monitor = strategy.should_intercept({})
# Returns: True (always)

# Intercept pulse
modified_qubit, was_intercepted = strategy.intercept(qubit)
# was_intercepted = True if n≥2 photons (stored one)
#                = False if n<2 photons (let through)
```

#### 3. Measurement After Basis Reconciliation

```python
# After Alice/Bob announce bases publicly
feedback = {'alice_bases': alice.bases}
strategy.update_strategy(feedback)
# Eve now measures stored photons in correct basis!
```

## Attack Statistics

### Performance Metrics

The PNS attack provides comprehensive statistics:

```python
stats = strategy.get_statistics()
```

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | Description | Typical Value |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `pulses_monitored` | Total pulses observed | 1000 |
| `multi_photon_pulses` | Pulses with n≥2 | 4-5 (μ=0.1) |
| `photons_stored` | Photons stolen | Same as multi-photon |
| `successful_extractions` | Bits gained | Same as stored |
| `multi_photon_probability_actual` | Observed P(n≥2) | 0.004-0.005 |
| `multi_photon_probability_theory` | Theoretical P(n≥2) | 0.0047 |
| `information_per_pulse_actual` | Bits/pulse (actual) | 0.004 |
| `information_per_pulse_expected` | Bits/pulse (theory) | 0.0047 |
| `qber_introduced` | **ALWAYS 0.0** | **0.0%** |
| `detection_probability` | **ALWAYS 0.0** | **0.0%** |
| `efficiency` | Success rate | **100%** |

---

## Mathematical Analysis

### Information Gain

For each multi-photon pulse, Eve gains:

```
I(E;A) = 1 bit  (perfect information!)
```

Expected information gain per pulse:

```
E[I] = P(n≥2) × 1 bit = [1 - (1 + μ)e^(-μ)] bits
```

**Total information for N pulses:**

```
I_total = N × P(n≥2) bits
```

### QBER Analysis

**Critical advantage**: PNS introduces **zero QBER**!

Traditional intercept-resend:
- QBER ≈ 25% (easily detected)

PNS attack:
- QBER = 0% (completely undetectable)
- No disturbance to Bob's measurements
- Perfect basis knowledge after announcement

### Security Threshold

For standard BB84, secure key rate with QBER:

```
R = 1 - 2H(QBER)
```

Where H is binary entropy.

**PNS bypasses this entirely**: QBER = 0, but Eve still extracts information!

---

## Distance Dependence

### Optimal μ Selection

For maximum key rate over lossy channel:

```
μ_opt ≈ η = 10^(-L/10)
```

Where:
- η = channel transmittance
- L = loss in dB

**Standard fiber**: 0.2 dB/km @ 1550nm

### Vulnerability vs. Distance

| Distance | Loss (dB) | μ_opt | P(n≥2) | Vuln Level |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------|------------|
| 10 km | 2.0 | 0.631 | 13.22% | **Critical** |
| 25 km | 5.0 | 0.316 | 4.06% | High |
| 50 km | 10.0 | 0.100 | 0.47% | Moderate |
| 100 km | 20.0 | 0.010 | 0.00% | Low |

**Key Finding**: Short-distance, high-throughput links are most vulnerable!

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic PNS Attack

```python
from src.main.bb84_main import (
    ClassicalBackend, PhotonNumberSplittingAttack,
    EveController, Alice, Bob, QuantumChannel
)

# Setup
backend = ClassicalBackend()
strategy = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack(backend, mean_photon_number=0.1)
eve = EveController(strategy, backend)
channel = QuantumChannel(backend, eve=eve)

alice = Alice(backend)
bob = Bob(backend)

# Run BB84
alice.generate_random_bits(1000)
alice.choose_random_bases(1000)
states = alice.prepare_states()

# Transmission (Eve monitors)
received = channel.transmit(states)

bob.choose_random_bases(len(received))
bob.measure_states(received)

# Basis reconciliation (public announcement)
feedback = {'alice_bases': alice.bases}
strategy.update_strategy(feedback)

# Check results
stats = strategy.get_statistics()
print(f"Multi-photon pulses: {stats['multi_photon_pulses']}")
print(f"Information gained: {stats['successful_extractions']} bits")
print(f"QBER introduced: {stats['qber_introduced']}%")  # Always 0%!
```

### Example 2: Vulnerability Analysis

```python
# Compare different μ values
for mu in [0.1, 0.2, 0.5]:
    prob = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack.probability_multi_photon(mu)
    info = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack.expected_information_gain(mu)
    
    print(f"μ = {mu:.1f}:")
    print(f"  P(n≥2) = {prob:.4f} ({prob*100:.2f}%)")
    print(f"  Info/pulse = {info:.4f} bits")
    print(f"  For 1000 pulses: {info*1000:.1f} bits")
```

### Example 3: Distance Optimization

```python
import numpy as np

# Calculate optimal μ for different distances
distances = [10, 25, 50, 100]  # km
fiber_loss = 0.2  # dB/km

for dist in distances:
    loss_db = dist * fiber_loss
    mu_opt = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack.optimal_mu_for_distance(loss_db)
    vuln = PhotonNumberSplittingAttack.probability_multi_photon(mu_opt)
    
    print(f"{dist} km: μ={mu_opt:.4f}, P(n≥2)={vuln:.4f} ({vuln*100:.2f}%)")
```

## Security Implications

### Why PNS is So Dangerous

1. **Undetectable**: QBER = 0% - no measurable disturbance
2. **Perfect information**: Eve knows correct basis after announcement
3. **Scales with throughput**: Higher μ → more vulnerability
4. **Practical threat**: Exploits real-world implementation limitations

### Affected Systems

**Vulnerable:**
- All weak coherent pulse BB84 systems
- High-throughput systems (μ > 0.2)
- Short-distance links (< 25 km)
- Systems without countermeasures

**Safe(r):**
- True single-photon sources (expensive, difficult)
- Decoy state protocols (practical countermeasure)
- Long-distance links (low μ_opt)

---

## Countermeasures

### 1. Decoy State Protocol

**Most practical defense**: Randomly vary μ between signal and decoy states.

**How it works:**
- Alice sends pulses with μ₁ (signal) and μ₂ < μ₁ (decoy)
- Eve's interception changes statistics differently
- Detect anomaly in decoy state statistics

**Effectiveness**: Reduces PNS vulnerability by 90%+

### 2. True Single-Photon Sources

**Ideal but impractical**:
- Quantum dots
- Parametric down-conversion
- Atom-based sources

**Challenges**: Low rates, high cost, technical complexity

### 3. Reduce Mean Photon Number

**Simple but limited**:
- Use lower μ (e.g., 0.05 instead of 0.1)
- Reduces vulnerability but also key rate
- Trade-off between security and performance

### 4. Entanglement-Based QKD

**Ultimate solution**:
- Use entangled photon pairs
- No multi-photon vulnerability
- Challenging to implement at scale

## Performance Comparison

### PNS vs. Other Attacks

| Attack | QBER Introduced | Information Gain | Detectability |
|--------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Intercept-Resend | ~25% | 0.5 bits/qubit | **High** |
| Adaptive | ~15-20% | 0.3-0.4 bits/qubit | Medium |
| QBER-Adaptive | ~10% | 0.4-0.5 bits/qubit | Low |
| Bayesian Learning | ~18% | 0.28 bits/qubit | Medium |
| Atmospheric | ~8-20% | 0.05-0.35 bits/qubit | Very Low |
| **PNS** | **0%** | **P(n≥2) bits/pulse** | **None!** |

**PNS is unique**: Only attack with zero disturbance!

**50 km link (μ_opt = 0.100):**
- 0.47% of pulses vulnerable
- Moderate threat
- Still requires countermeasures

**100 km link (μ_opt = 0.010):**
- ~0% of pulses vulnerable
- PNS threat negligible
- Channel loss dominates
